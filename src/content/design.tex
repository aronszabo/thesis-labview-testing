\section{Goals}
My goal is to implement a tool in LabVIEW, which can provide test inputs for a single VI, its front panel controls or input terminals. These test inputs should cover all the possible execution paths (in the case of LabVIEW, all the subdiagrams, or all combination of subdiagrams). After running the tool, outputs for each input set can be easily defined executing the VI. A tool like this can later help with unit test generation: using the generated input and output sets, xUnit-style tests can be created automatically, which will have 100\% branch (diagram) coverage.

According to my knowledge, no such tool exists for LabVIEW yet, so a simple tool created for the BSc thesis can be later be improved and used in an automatic test generation project.

A possible solution is symbolic execution of the VI: defining the input controls (data accessors) as symbolic variables, the constraint solver will try to determine the values in all the execution tree leafs.

The topic of symbolic execution is well defined in the area of procedural programming, but not for dataflow programming.

\end{figure}

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single,float=!ht,caption={The same program using a procedural paradigm},captionpos=b,label={lst:proceduralexample},language=]
IN: i
(w1,w2) = A(i)
w3 = B(w1)
w4 = C(i)
w5 = D(w2,w4)
o = w3 + w5
OUT: o
\end{lstlisting}

I decided to convert the dataflow program to a procedural one, this means to define the execution order of nodes and turning the data flow wires into variables. This is possible, since executing a program in LabVIEW does the same - when running on the computer, the nodes execute in some order after each other. A node can execute, when all the input values are ready. This can also be observed in the development environment using the Highlight Execution tool, after executing a node the output values will slowly move to the next node. A G program cannot contain a wire cycle (except with feedback nodes), thus the nodes form a directed acyclic graph, which will have a topological ordering. When two or more topological ordering exist, it may be worth to choose the one that has forking statements later in the execution, to reduce execution time. Control structures will be quite easy to handle: case structures and loops are subdiagrams on a VI, and during conversion the contents of subdiagrams will become parts of If-Else statements and While loops. 



If performed correctly, the conversion will produce a simple algorithmic representation of the dataflow program. Symbolic execution can now be performed.

Another issue is dealing with nodes that depend on external data source, or those that perform an operation that is not supported by the constraint solver.


\section{Architecture}

The final architecture of the tool, based on the reasons above, will consist of the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Access the object model of the tested Virtual Instrument
  \item Generate a procedural representation of the dataflow program
  \item Execute the procedural program with the inputs of the VI as symbolic variables 
   \item Use a constraint solver to calculate the symbolic variables
in the leafs of the symbolic tree
     \item Display the calculated inputs (or use them to build a unit test)
  
  \end{itemize}

The first step depends entirely on the programming interface of NI software, so it will be a topic of the implementation section. The
