\section{Testing embedded systems}
Testing hardware prototypes has always been a difficult step of production, since it requires designing a test environment, which can be nearly as much effort as designing the product itself. Fortunately, there are hardware testing tools on the market, that can make this process rapid and efficient, providing solutions for the common tasks in testing. One of these toolkits is the set of hardware and software by National Instuments, which includes measurement and control modules, real-time and FPGA hardware, and a graphic programming environment, making prototyping easy.
