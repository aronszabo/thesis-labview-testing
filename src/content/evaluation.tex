\section{Displaying the procedural program}
During development, and when running the finished tool, it became very important to see the output of the parser part in an easy to read form. The C\# debugger did not fit for that job, since despite that I could see the object hierarchy, and inspect values and statements one-by-one, I could not see the converted program as a whole. 

Therefore, I overrode the ToString functions for all the model objects to return an easy to read string reflecting its contents. After that, all I had to do was to call ToString on a \textit{Sequence} object, and it returned a pseudo-code of the converted program.

In the following examples, the shown converted procedural examples are the output of this routine.
\section{Small demos}
\paragraph{Demo "A"}
For the first demo I used the same program, which I used to demonstrate symbolic execution in the Background section (Listing \ref{lst:symbolic_test}). The dataflow counterpart of that program\footnote{The demo VIs, and other test VIs (mentioned in the Requirements table) are included in the attachment. See appendix for more details.} can be seen on Figure \ref{fig:testvi1}.

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single,float=!ht,caption={The converted procedural version of VI "A"},captionpos=b,label={lst:testvi1_proc},language=]
A = [x]; 
B = 3; 
C = 0; 
D = (A < B); 
IF D Then
E = (A + 1); 
ELSE
E = A; 
End IF
F = (E > C); 
IF F Then
G = (E - 1); 
ELSE
G = E; 
End IF
[Output] : G; 
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{1} & $x< 3\wedge x+1> 0$ & $x=0$                              \\ \hline

\textbf{3} & $\neg(x< 3)\wedge x>0$ & $x=3$                     \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Results of Demo A}
  \label{Tab:testvi1resu}
\end{table}
The outputs of symbolic execution in this example (Listing \ref{lst:testvi1_sym}) are the same as the expected (see Figure \ref{fig:symbolic_test}), and the unreachable fourth execution path $(!([x] < 3) \& !([x] > 0))$ is omitted from the list.

To verify the correctness of the results, I ran the VI with these inputs, to see if they really produce different execution paths. As seen on Figure \ref{fig:verify1}, all the possible paths have been covered with this input set.

\caption{Run VI "A" with the result values as input} 
\label{fig:verify1}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Demo "B"}
I wanted to test, if nesting case structures behaves correctly, therefore the second demo features nested structures (Figure \ref{fig:testvi2}). When \textit{outside var} is false, \textit{inside var} should not matter in the path condition. Additionally, this test verifies, that boolean input values are processed correctly.

\section{Results of testing}

% lista a tovabbi tesztesetekrol
I tested the tool with a number of other self-made VIs as input. Although there were bugs in some cases in the parser, when creating a certain pattern on the block diagram (resulting in an exception), the overall results indicate, that the tool is working correctly, and gives the correct outputs.

The tool runs on these simple VIs, almost instantaneously.


Since the prototype lacks support for more fundamental LabVIEW elements, unfortunately, I was unable to demonstrate it on a real-life application.

\caption{Fulfilled requirements}
  \label{Tab:Requ}
\end{table}


The requirements specified in the Design chapter have been fulfilled, the creation of the prototype was successful.

\paragraph{Known bugs} If the tunnels of two nested subdiagrams are directly connected, the parser crashes, or gives wrong output. I was not able to fix that during the period of my BSc thesis.
